# DSA C++ Codes

This repository contains solutions to various **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems written in C++. It includes:

- âœ… DSA questions from different platforms
- ðŸ§© Basic implementations of common DSA algorithms and data structures
- ðŸ“š Code written for practice, learning, and interviews

## Contents

- Sorting algorithms
- Searching algorithms
- Recursion and backtracking
- Dynamic programming
- Graph algorithms
- Tree and binary tree problems
- Linked list implementations
- Stack and queue operations
- Miscellaneous coding challenges

## Language

All solutions are written in **C++**.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a **personal archive of DSA practice** and a **reference** for revising core concepts.
